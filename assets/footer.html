                        <h3>Are there any hidden charges (Octroi or Sales Tax) when I make a purchase on OnlineShopping ?</h3>
                        <p>There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on OnlineShopping. The prices listed for all the items are final and all-inclusive. The price you see on the product page is exactly what you pay.
                           Delivery charges may be extra depending on the seller policy. Please check individual seller for the same. In case of seller WS Retail, the ₹50 delivery charge is waived off on orders worth ₹500 and over.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What is Cash on Delivery?</h3>
                        <p>If you are not comfortable making an online payment on OnlineShopping.com, you can opt for the Cash on Delivery (C-o-D) payment method instead.

                        <h3>What are the delivery charges?</h3>
                        <p>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.
                           Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. The delivery charge may be waived off by some Sellers, if you shop with them for a minimum predefined value.
                           For example, seller WS Retail charges Rs 40 for delivery per item if the order value is less than Rs 500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are delivered free. Please check with individual Sellers to understand their delivery charges.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?</h3>
                        <p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day your placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates.</p>
                        <h3>What is the estimated delivery time?</h3>
                        <p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.
                           Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:
                           The Seller offering the product
                           Product's availability with the Seller
                           The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi etc) on items sold by Sellers on Flipkart?</h3>
                        <p>There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on Flipkart. List prices are final and all-inclusive. The price you see on the product page is exactly what you would pay.
                           Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if at all) extra depending on the Seller's shipping policy.

      <h3 class="w3-center">Shipping</h3>
      <h3>What are the delivery charges?</h3>
      <p>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.
      Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. The delivery charge may be waived off by some Sellers, if you shop with them for a minimum predefined value.
      For example, seller WS Retail charges Rs 40 for delivery per item if the order value is less than Rs 500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are delivered free. Please check with individual Sellers to understand their delivery charges.
      </p>
      <h3>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?</h3>
      <p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day your placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery dates.</p>
      <h3>What is the estimated delivery time?</h3>
      <p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.
      Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:
      The Seller offering the product
      Product's availability with the Seller
      The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.
      </p>
      <h3>Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi etc) on items sold by Sellers on Flipkart?</h3>
      <p>There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on Flipkart. List prices are final and all-inclusive. The price you see on the product page is exactly what you would pay.
      Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if at all) extra depending on the Seller's shipping policy.
